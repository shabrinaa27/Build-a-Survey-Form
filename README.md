# Build a Survey
##### Hello! It’s me! Someone who truly enjoys the learning journey on the path to becoming a great programmer. 
#
I'd like to share my first project, which I created from a course on freeCodeCamp. After learning and practicing HTML and CSS, I finally built my own project based on what I had learned. This was one of the tasks I needed to complete to earn my certificate. I’m really proud that I managed to finish it on my own (of course, with the help of my notes from the class and practice sessions, but without looking at anyone else’s repository). I’m excited to share it here!

For this project, I'll build a survey form to collect data from my users. For this project, I used HTML to structure the content of the website and CSS to 'style' it, making it more visually appealing.

Enjoy!
